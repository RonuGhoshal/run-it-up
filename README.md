# Run It Up

This app is hosted at https://run-it-rg1a5rk0z-ronu-ghoshals-projects.vercel.app/

See https://github.com/RonuGhoshal/run-it-up-api for the API.

## TODOS

- Tweak prompt for better quality running plans - for example, enforce a minimum/maximum mileage per week based on the input data
- Generate response faster - right now it is taking > 1 min to generate a plan. See if we can display the plan in real-time as it is generated, using chunks.
- Determine the best way to evaluate responses in order to improve response quality.
